# Code Book
Data Set: tidy_data.txt

December, 2014

Codebook prepared by Michael Cooley based on a data set created for a Corsera Getting and Cleaning Data course

The dataset contains 180 observations of 68 variables.  One variable is the subject_id, 30 possible values, and another is an activity, six possible values.  The remainder are summary statistics (the mean) for variables from a larger data set.  Information on this data set can be found in the ReadMe file in this repository.

|   |   |
| ------- | ------- |
| Field label:		| subject_id |
| Variable:		| Subject identifier 
| Variable type:		| Number
|Comments:		| Identifier for one of the 30 subjects
| 			| 
| Field label:		| activity
| Variable:		| Activity Name
| Variable type:		| String
|Comments:		| Description of the activity

Note:  the remaining entries in the code book refer to a series of variables (columns) in the tidy data file.  The Field Lable Series shows the prefix of the name of a series of several variables rather than just one variable.  The data set is tidy, but the code book is less so to save some space and avoid lots of repitition.

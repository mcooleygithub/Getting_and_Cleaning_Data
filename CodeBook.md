Data Set: tidy_data.txt

December, 2014

Codebook prepared by Michael Cooley based on a data set created for a Corsera Getting and Cleaning Data course

The dataset contains 180 observations of 68 variables.  One variable is the subject_id, 30 in total, and another is an activity, six in total.  The remainder are summary statistics (the mean) for variables in a larger data set.
